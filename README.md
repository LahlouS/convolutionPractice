### ConvolutionPractice

A collection of workshops I completed to learn about CNNs during my internship at PMU.

I did my internship as a Computer Vision Engineer.

All of these workshops are based on the amazing work of [Sentivel Tharsan ](https://github.com/thad75/thad75), who was my tutor during the internship.

A big thank you to him!
